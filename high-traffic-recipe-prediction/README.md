This project aims to identify recipes that are likely to generate high traffic on an online food platform. The project includes :
- analyzing historical data on user interactions, recipe content, and other relevant features
- processing data and engineering features for machine learning models
- testing different machine learning algorithms and choose the most effictive
- hyperparameters tunning for chosen model and making predictions
