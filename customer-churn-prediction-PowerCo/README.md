In this project i developed a Streamlit app that you can try [here](https://machine-learning-qmmzenbm7jhzlrcvgn8ijh.streamlit.app/) in order to predict churn for PowerCo company, a major gas and electricity utility supplier.
The primary objective of this project is to test the clientâ€™s hypothesis that customer churn is driven by price sensitivity. The app analyzes customer data to validate this hypothesis.
The user can play with the model's hyperparameters and make new predictions. Feel free to send me your feedback and suggestions to improve this app.
