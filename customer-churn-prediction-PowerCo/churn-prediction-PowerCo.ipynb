With `ensemble` methods, instead of banking on 1 single trained model, we can train 1000's of decision trees, all using different splits of the data and learning different patterns. It would be like asking 1000 people to all learn how to code. You would end up with 1000 people with different answers, methods and styles! The weak learner notion applies here too, it has been found that if you train your learners not to overfit, but to learn weak patterns within the data and you have a lot of these weak learners, together they come together to form a highly predictive pool of knowledge! This is a real life application of many brains are better than 1.\n","\n","Now instead of relying on 1 single decision tree for prediction, the random forest puts it to the overall views of the entire collection of decision trees. Some ensemble algorithms using a voting approach to decide which prediction is best, others using averaging. \n","\n","As we increase the number of learners, the idea is that the random forest's performance should converge to its best possible solution.\n","\n","Some additional advantages of the random forest classifier include:\n","\n","- Rule-based approach instead of a distance calculation and so features do not need to be scaled\n","- Ability to handle non-linear parameters better than linear based models\n","\n","On the flip side, some disadvantages of the random forest classifier include:\n","\n","- The computational power needed to train a random forest on a large dataset is high, since we need to build a whole ensemble of estimators.\n","- Training time can be longer due to the increased complexity and size of thee ensemble"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":10,"metadata":{"id":"km_R7pYnUSKX"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<style>#sk-container-id-1 {color: black;}#sk-container-id-1 pre{padding: 0;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-toggleable {background-color: white;}#sk-container-id-1 label.sk-toggleable__label {cursor: pointer;display: block;width: 100%;margin-bottom: 0;padding: 0.3em;box-sizing: border-box;text-align: center;}#sk-container-id-1 label.sk-toggleable__label-arrow:before {content: \"â–¸\";float: left;margin-right: 0.25em;color: #696969;}#sk-container-id-1 label.sk-toggleable__label-arrow:hover:before {color: black;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-estimator:hover label.sk-toggleable__label-arrow:before {color: black;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-toggleable__content {max-height: 0;max-width: 0;overflow: hidden;text-align: left;background-color: #f0f8ff;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-toggleable__content pre {margin: 0.2em;color: black;border-radius: 0.25em;background-color: #f0f8ff;}#sk-container-id-1 input.sk-toggleable__control:checked~div.sk-toggleable__content {max-height: 200px;max-width: 100%;overflow: auto;}#sk-container-id-1 input.sk-toggleable__control:checked~label.sk-toggleable__label-arrow:before {content: \"â–¾\";}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-estimator input.sk-toggleable__control:checked~label.sk-toggleable__label {background-color: #d4ebff;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-label input.sk-toggleable__control:checked~label.sk-toggleable__label {background-color: #d4ebff;}#sk-container-id-1 input.sk-hidden--visually {border: 0;clip: rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);height: 1px;margin: -1px;overflow: hidden;padding: 0;position: absolute;width: 1px;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-estimator {font-family: monospace;background-color: #f0f8ff;border: 1px dotted black;border-radius: 0.25em;box-sizing: border-box;margin-bottom: 0.5em;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-estimator:hover {background-color: #d4ebff;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-parallel-item::after {content: \"\";width: 100%;border-bottom: 1px solid gray;flex-grow: 1;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-label:hover label.sk-toggleable__label {background-color: #d4ebff;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-serial::before {content: \"\";position: absolute;border-left: 1px solid gray;box-sizing: border-box;top: 0;bottom: 0;left: 50%;z-index: 0;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-serial {display: flex;flex-direction: column;align-items: center;background-color: white;padding-right: 0.2em;padding-left: 0.2em;position: relative;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-item {position: relative;z-index: 1;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-parallel {display: flex;align-items: stretch;justify-content: center;background-color: white;position: relative;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-item::before, #sk-container-id-1 div.sk-parallel-item::before {content: \"\";position: absolute;border-left: 1px solid gray;box-sizing: border-box;top: 0;bottom: 0;left: 50%;z-index: -1;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-parallel-item {display: flex;flex-direction: column;z-index: 1;position: relative;background-color: white;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-parallel-item:first-child::after {align-self: flex-end;width: 50%;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-parallel-item:last-child::after {align-self: flex-start;width: 50%;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-parallel-item:only-child::after {width: 0;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-dashed-wrapped {border: 1px dashed gray;margin: 0 0.4em 0.5em 0.4em;box-sizing: border-box;padding-bottom: 0.4em;background-color: white;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-label label {font-family: monospace;font-weight: bold;display: inline-block;line-height: 1.2em;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-label-container {text-align: center;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-container {/* jupyter's `normalize.less` sets `[hidden] { display: none; }` but bootstrap.min.css set `[hidden] { display: none !important; }` so we also need the `!important` here to be able to override the default hidden behavior on the sphinx rendered scikit-learn.org.
